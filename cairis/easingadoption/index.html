<p>Although the blog has been quiet in recent months, a lot has been happening with CAIRIS.  As a result of this work, it’s now easier than ever for both users and developers to adopt the tool.  Here is a quick summary of these changes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The CAIRIS source code on <a href="https://github.com/failys/cairis">github</a> has been reorganised.  Everything is now properly structured into modules, making it easier for new developers to figure out where everything is, and how different components work together.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We’ve introduced several initiatives to improve the code quality and maintainability of CAIRIS.  The repository has now been linked up with <a href="https://travis-ci.org/failys/cairis">Travis</a> and <a href="https://coveralls.io/github/failys/cairis?branch=master">Coveralls</a>, to provide continuous integration and coverage testing for repository changes.  The repository also has <a href="https://requires.io/github/failys/cairis/requirements/?branch=master">requires.io</a> integration, to ensure that CAIRIS’ dependencies are automatically monitored.  We’ve added badges to the README file on github, so people can quickly check CAIRIS’ stability.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>CAIRIS is now available as a package on <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cairis">PyPI</a>.  As you will see on the <a href="http://cairis.org/install/">installation page</a>, this vastly simplifies the installation process; this now entails little more than installing dependent packages, installing CAIRIS using <code>pip install</code>, and running a script to configure the CAIRIS database.  Moreover, we’re currently working on a Debian package for CAIRIS so, very soon, it will be possible to install and configure CAIRIS using just a single command.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We’ve started the process of integrating <a href="https://github.com/RobinQuetin/CAIRIS-web">CAIRIS-web</a> into the master CAIRIS repository.  In the first instance, we will be developing web services for frequently used CAIRIS functionality.  However, in time, we plan to re-start work on a CAIRIS web app.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
